# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component solution

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

### Built With

- React.js
- TailWind CSS

### What I learned

Learned how to switch components when a button is clicked which allowed for me change the card content when the submit button is clicked. I also passed props to a component, which allowed me to use another components variables. This is shown with number you selected on the thank you screen. Although I tried I wasn't able to find a way to only allow the user to select one option at a time. I'm sure it is simple enough to do but I struggled.
